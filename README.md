# Black-Jack
Blackjack is a popular card game where the goal is to beat the dealer by having the higher hand which does not exceed 21. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack. Blackjack hands are scored by their point total, calculated by adding together the face values of each card dealt. The hand with the highest total wins, as long as it doesn’t exceed 21. A hand with a higher total than 21 is said to bust. Being dealt an Ace (of any suit) counts as eleven (11) points unless this would cause the player to bust, in which case it is worth one (1) point. Picture cards (King, Queen and Jack) are all worth 10 points. All other cards are worth their numerical value shown on the card.

<b>Blackjack Game Play:</b>
<br>• To begin, the player and the dealer are dealt an initial hand of two cards each.
<br>• If the dealer has Blackjack (the first two cards dealt total 21 points) and the player does not, the dealer
automatically wins.
<br>• If the player has Blackjack (the first two cards dealt total 21 points) and the dealer does not, the player
automatically wins.
<br>• If both the player and the dealer have Blackjack (the first two cards dealt total 21 points) then it is a push
(draw).
<br>• If neither have Blackjack, then the player plays out his/her hand. Note that the term Blackjack can only be
achieved as a result of the first two cards dealt.
<br>• When the player has finished playing out his/her hand, the dealer (in this case the computer) plays out the
dealer’s hand.
<br>• During the player’s turn, the player is faced with two options either:
1. Hit (take a card):
After the initial deal of two cards, a player may choose to receive additional cards as many times as
he/she wishes, adding the point value of each card to his/her hand total.
2. Stand (end their turn):
Do not receive any more cards. The player’s turn is over.
<br>• The player repeatedly takes a card until, the player chooses to stand, or the player busts (that is, exceeds a
total of 21). The player’s turn is over after deciding to stand or if he/she busts.
<br>• Once the player has finished, the dealer plays out his/her hand (in this case the computer), revealing the
hidden second card amount. Note: the dealer always plays his/her hand regardless of what happens with
the player’s hand. The dealer must hit until he or she has a point value of 17 or greater.

<b>Blackjack Rules:</b>
<br>• If the player busts, he/she loses even if the dealer also busts.
<br>• If the player and the dealer have the same point value, it is called a ‘push’ and neither win the hand (draw).
<br>• An initial two-card deal of 21 (an 11 plus a 10) is called Blackjack (i.e. an 11 plus a 10 is dealt as the very first
hand) and wins the round automatically.
<br>• An Ace counts as eleven (11) points unless this would cause the player/dealer to bust, in which case it is
worth one (1) point.

<b>House Rules:</b>
<br>• The dealer must hit until he or she has a point value of 17 or greater.
<br>• The player can not stand on a point value less than 15.
